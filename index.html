# Learning Plan: Coding for Games & HTML

## 1. Foundations: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **HTML**: Learn the structure of web pages (tags, elements, attributes)
- **CSS**: Style your pages (colors, layouts, fonts, animations)
- **JavaScript**: Make your pages interactive (events, variables, loops, functions)

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs - HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [MDN Web Docs - CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## 2. Practice Mini Projects
- Build a personal website or portfolio
- Make a simple interactive button or animation
- Try a basic quiz or calculator

## 3. Game Development Basics (with JavaScript)
- Learn about the `<canvas>` element for drawing
- Practice moving shapes with keyboard input
- Make a simple game (e.g. Pong, Snake, or a clicker game)

**Resources:**
- [MDN Canvas Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial)
- [JavaScript Game Tutorials by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc)

## 4. Level Up: Game Features
- Implement game loops and collision detection
- Add scoring, levels, and sound
- Try using libraries like [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) or [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) for more complex games

## 5. Share and Get Feedback
- Learn Git & GitHub basics
- Upload your projects to GitHub (share your code, showcase your progress)
- Join communities (like r/gamedev, Stack Overflow, or Discord servers for game dev)

## 6. Keep Building!
- Make clones of classic games—Tic-Tac-Toe, Breakout, Flappy Bird
- Experiment with graphics and sound
- Collaborate with friends or online communities

### **Sample Weekly Plan**

| Week | Focus                                  |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| 1    | HTML & CSS basics, build simple pages  |
| 2    | JavaScript basics, add interactions    |
| 3    | Canvas API, draw/move shapes           |
| 4    | Make your first mini-game              |
| 5-6  | Add more features, try a game library  |
| 7+   | Build bigger games, join game jams     |

---

### **Tips for Success**
- Practice every day, even for a short time.
- Start small, then add features as you learn.
- Break games into smaller tasks (e.g., movement, collision, scoring).
- Don’t be afraid to ask for help or look things up.
- Share your games and be proud of your progress!
